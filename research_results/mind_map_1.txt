2.2 Agentic Reasoning Pipeline Our core idea is to enhance the model reasoning by deploying external LLM-based agents during reasoning. The framework enables the reasoning LLM model interacts with external information in an agentic way. During its reasoning process, it could call the external tools to help solve the problem and also with a structured memory, called Mind Map, to store its reasoning context. At its core, an agentic mechanism empowers the model to determine, in real-time, when additional information is required. whenever the model identify the external information is needed during its reasoning, it will proactively embeds specialized tokens into its reasoning tokens. These tokens can be generally categorized to web-search token, coding token, and mind-map calling token. Together with token, the reasoning model would also generate a precise query as a message to interact with these external agents, based on the reasoning context developed so far. Upon detecting such a token, the reasoning process temporarily halts to extract the query and its reasoning context. Those are then dispatched to external agents, such as search engines or Mind Map, to generate pertinent content. The generation would consider both the message received and the reasoning context to make sure returning the most relevant results. These results are then reintegrated into the reasoning chain, allowing the model to continue its inference with an updated and enriched knowledge. This iterative retrieval-and-reasoning cycle continues as needed, enabling the model to dynamically refine its conclusions until it reaches a fully reasoned final answer.
