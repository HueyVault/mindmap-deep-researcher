2.3 Mind Map Agent
We construct a Mind Map to store and structure
the real-time reasoning context of the reasoning
model. This Mind Map is built by transforming
raw reasoning chains into a structured knowledge
graph. Specifically, we use a graph-construction
LLM to extract entities from the reasoning chain
and identify semantic relationships between related
entities, following a process similar to that used in
GraphRAG (Edge et al., 2024).
The Mind Map serves two primary functions.
First, it clusters reasoning context into distinct
groups and summarizes each theme. This is
achieved by applying community clustering (Edge
et al., 2024) on the knowledge graph and using an
LLM to generate concise summaries for each group.
Second, the knowledge graph can be queried with
specific questions, such as "Who was Jason's maternal great-grandfather?" Using standard retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) on the knowledge
graph (Edge et al., 2024), we retrieve and return
relevant information.
These functions integrate the Mind Map into
various aspects of the Agentic Reasoning process.
It provides contextual reasoning support to external tools, enabling them to generate more contextaware responses (as discussed in later sections).
Additionally, when the reasoning model is uncertain about its claims or loses track in an extended
reasoning process, it can query the Mind Map for
relevant information, treating it as an external tool,
and continue reasoning based on the retrieved answer.
