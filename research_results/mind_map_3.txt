3.3.2 The Role of Mind Map
Figure 4: A tricky question that misleads most LLMs is
correctly answered by us.
We find that Mind Maps are particularly effective in clarifying complex logical relationships, enabling the model to solve problems that often mislead traditional LLMs. We highlight two key cases
where Mind Mapping maximizes its capabilities:
First, Mind Maps help correctly answer tricky
logic-based questions that frequently fool LLMs. A
well-known example is a modified riddle: "The surgeon, who is the boy's father, says 'I can't operate
on this child, he's my son!' Who is the surgeon to
the boy?" DeepSeek-R1 took 17 seconds to process
this question but still produced the wrong answer, a
failure also observed in models from the GPT and
Gemini series models. These models often fall for
a political-correct corpus contaminated response,
failing to recognize the obvious logical structure.
However, in our Agentic Reasoning framework, the
use of a Mind Map allows the model to explicitly
analyze the logical relationships between the entities [surgeon], [boy], and [father], leading to the
correct answer.
Second, Mind Maps enhance deductive reasoning in strategic games. We test our approach in
Werewolf, a classic social deduction game where
players take on hidden roles as either villagers or
werewolves. Villagers attempt to identify the werewolves, while werewolves deceive the group and
eliminate players without being caught. The game
alternates between "night", where werewolves secretly attack, and "day", where players debate and
vote on eliminations. To evaluate our Agentic
Reasoning model, we invited seven experienced
Werewolf players (5+ years of experience) to play
against it. The model achieved an impressive 72%
win rate, significantly exceeding both the expected
statistical win rate and the performance of human
players in our experiment.
We analyzed the Mind Maps generated by the
Agentic Reasoning model over multiple rounds of
play, as shown in Figure 5. These visual structures
helped the model track the relationships between
different players based on their spoken arguments,
allowing it to more accurately identify deception
strategies, anticipate voting behaviors, and optimize its own disguise tactics. This result demonstrates that Mind Mapping is not just a tool for
logic puzzles but also a powerful strategy enhancer
in dynamic reasoning environments.
